Tim urban is an internet nerd.

He is my favourite blogger of all time, sent to this planet to observe a phenomenon, break it down to its absolute core elements and then describe it in a memorable way using analogies, diagrams and humour.

He is a master at creating layers of abstraction. He introduces small building blocks and lines them up neatly until you come away with a deep understanding of a complex topic. So it’s not surprising that his posts are tens of thousands of words or more long. 

With every post you read, there is life before that post and life after that post. They leave a lasting impact, they form a type of mental model. A novel or deeper way of thinking about a topic. 

Let's cover some of his best ideas and abstraction layers.

The name I use to call Tim Urban's ideas.

<!-- ## [Chef vs Cook](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html) -->


In 2015, Tim received a call from Elon Musk's assistant asking him to write about his ventures to help people understand why he does what he does.

Naturally, Tim jumped at the opportunity and wrote some mind-bending posts about [SpaceX](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/08/how-and-why-spacex-will-colonize-mars.html), [Tesla](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html), [Solar City](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/the-deal-with-solar.html), [Hyperloop](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/hyperloop.html) and [Neuralink](https://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html). But in addition to unpacking the why of what Elon does, Tim used this opportunity to understand "why Musk is able to do what he’s doing". What his "secret sauce" is and Why people like him are so rare.


> "The thing that tantalized me is that this secret sauce is actually accessible to everyone and right there in front of us"


<!-- Musk calls this “reasoning from first principles.” I’ll let him explain:
I think generally people’s thinking process is too bound by convention or analogy to prior experiences. It’s rare that people try to think of something on a first principles basis. They’ll say, “We’ll do that because it’s always been done that way.” Or they’ll not do it because “Well, nobody’s ever done that, so it must not be good.” But that’s just a ridiculous way to think. You have to build up the reasoning from the ground up—“from the first principles” is the phrase that’s used in physics. You look at the fundamentals and construct your reasoning from that, and then you see if you have a conclusion that works or doesn’t work, and it may or may not be different from what people have done in the past.
He uses the analogy of cook vs chef to explain it. -->

Tim compares the two types of thinking that separates us and history-changing humans like Elon, to being a cook vs being a chef. "When I say chef, I don’t mean any ordinary chef. I mean the trailblazing chef—the kind of chef who invents recipes. And for our purposes, everyone else who enters a kitchen—all those who follow recipes—is a cook."


"The chef reasons from first principles, and for the chef, the first principles are raw edible ingredients. Those are her puzzle pieces, her building blocks, and she works her way upwards from there, using her experience, her instincts, and her taste buds."
whereas, "The cook works off of some version of what’s already out there—a recipe of some kind, a meal she tried and liked, a dish she watched someone else make."

When we think of Elon, we think "that he’s a visionary, that he can somehow see things we cannot. We see it like this:"

<!-- By ignoring conventional wisdom in favor of simply looking at the present for what it really is and staying up-to-date with the facts of the world as they change in real-time—in spite of what conventional wisdom has to say—the chef can act on information the rest of us haven’t been given permission to act on yet. -->


"This is what Elon had to say: _Sometimes people fear starting a company too much. Really, what’s the worst that could go wrong? You’re not gonna starve to death, you’re not gonna die of exposure—what’s the worst that could go wrong?
But "Being a chef isn’t being like Elon Musk—it’s being yourself."_"

<!-- "In other words, you might be a star and a leader in your world or in the eyes of your part of society, but if the core reason you picked that goal in the first place was because your tribe’s cookbook says that it’s an impressive thing and it makes the other tribe members gawk, you’re not being a leader—you’re being a super-successful follower. And, as Einstein says, no less of a cook than all those whom you’ve impressed.
To see the truth, you need to zoom way out until you can see the real leader of the cooks—the cookbook." -->

The Human Colossus — the collective knowledge that humanity has built — is the idea that an individual is unable to create even a pencil on their own, but collectively and through our large body of accumulated knowledge we are able to land on the moon.

As Tim puts it,
“With the entire body of collective human knowledge in its brain, the Human Colossus began inventing things no human could have dreamed of inventing on their own—things that would have seemed like absurd science fiction to people only a few generations before.”

<a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html"><h1 style="font-size: 1.6em;">The Instant Gratification Monkey</h1><a>

<img src="/waitbutwhy/monkey.png"
    style="width: 100%;

</img>

The instant gratification monkey is the creature responsible for procrastination.

"The fact is, the Instant Gratification Monkey is the last creature who should be in charge of decisions—he thinks only about the present, ignoring lessons from the past and disregarding the future altogether, and he concerns himself entirely with maximizing the ease and pleasure of the current moment. He doesn’t understand the Rational Decision-Maker any better than the Rational Decision-Maker understands him—why would we continue doing this jog, he thinks, when we could stop, which would feel better. Why would we practice that instrument when it’s not fun? Why would we ever use a computer for work when the internet is sitting right there waiting to be played with? He thinks humans are insane."

"The Panic Monster is dormant most of the time, but he suddenly wakes up when a deadline gets too close or when there’s danger of public embarrassment, a career disaster, or some other scary consequence."

<a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/06/taming-mammoth-let-peoples-opinions-run-life.html"><h1 style="font-size: 1.6em;">The Social Survival Mammoth</h1><a>

The social survival mammoth is yet another elegant abstraction character that demonstrates why we are evolved to care so much about what others think.

<img src="/waitbutwhy/social-survival-mammoth.png"
    style="width: 90%;

    alt="">
</img>


"The mammoth’s hurricane of fear of social disapproval plays a factor in most parts of most people’s lives. It’s what makes you feel weird about going to a restaurant or a movie alone; it’s what makes parents care a little too much about where their child goes to college; it’s what makes you pass up a career you’d love in favor of a more lucrative career you’re lukewarm about; it’s what makes you get married before you’re ready to a person you’re not in love with."


"Sometimes, a mammoth’s focus isn’t on wider society as much as it’s on winning the approval of a Puppet Master in your life. A Puppet Master is a person or group of people whose opinion matters so much to you that they’re essentially running your life. A Puppet Master is often a parent, or maybe your significant other, or sometimes an alpha member of your group of friends. A Puppet Master can be a person you look up to who you don’t know very well—maybe even a celebrity you’ve never met—or a group of people you hold in especially high regard."

<img src="/waitbutwhy/mammoth-2.png"
    style="width: 100%;

</img>

"We crave the Puppet Master’s approval more than anyone’s, and we’re so horrified at the thought of upsetting the Puppet Master or feeling their nonacceptance or ridicule that we’ll do anything to avoid it. When we get to this toxic state in our relationship with a Puppet Master, that person’s presence hangs over our entire decision-making process and pulls the strings of our opinions and our moral voice."

<h1 style="font-size: 2.1em;">Why is Wait But Why different...</h1>
<!-- <h1 style="font-size: 2.1em;">Creating Abstraction Layers </h1> -->

Tim disappears for months at a time. It's been a year since his last post, but creating abstraction layers requires incubation. To give you some perspective, I counted at least 14 layers of abstraction in [this](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html) post.

I’d like to imagine him in his writing cave, his right arm being pulled by the instant gratification monkey and his left arm pulled by the panic monster. Maybe once in a while he comes out of his cave at the request of his social survival mammoth, only to be sent back by his chef software. 


But it’s always worth the wait.
