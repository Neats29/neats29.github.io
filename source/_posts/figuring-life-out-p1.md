Two decades into the 21st century, we find ourselves in the age of abundance of *information* and *choice*. We no longer end up in a profession determined at birth by what our father, his father and __his__ father did. In those days, you weren’t presented much choice, you just worked on you father’s farm, and there were a small number of total professions in your community that you knew about. But today, almost everyone is confused and dissatisfied because we are faced with 4 problems:

1. __The wealth of choice__ - there is a wide range of professions to choose from but we can only do one at a time, and only a handful in our lifetime

3. __Known unknown possibilities__ - we know there must be professions that would match our skills and interests but we don’t always know what they are, or we don't yet have access to information that would otherwise help us invent our own path

4. __FOMO__ - the internet creates dissatisfaction because there are always those who are perceived to be doing better, which perpetuates the other 2 problems

Another common problem that some of us face is [sunk cost fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost) - we think we might be on the wrong path but we’ve already spent a number of years in this current area, so we don’t want all that time to go to waste and start from scratch. To confuse matters more, it’s incredibly hard to know whether your mind telling you to stick it out is due to sunk cost fallacy or the grit you need to get through a temporary phase of dissatisfaction.

This is like going to a restaurant where you are presented with a buffet from all cuisines, but you are supposed to choose only one cuisine, after which you are only allowed to eat this cuisine until further notice. Meanwhile you find out that you weren’t actually presented with all of the cuisines, there are some you didn’t know about. To make matters worse, the restaurants your friends eat at which seem better are not accessible to you. Of course you are going to be dissatisfied sooner or later. The above scenario might seem comical, but it’s actually the reality we find ourselves in, at a much broader scale.

I don’t excatly have a solution to the above, but I’m nevertheless obsessed with it and over the last couple of years I have been collecting resources that have helped me better navigate this conundrum.

Ultimately, most of it comes down to access to the right information. Information from within and without.

I’ve also found that managing one’s own career is a meta job in itself, the two things I’ve found most effective are:
* Every few months, taking a step back to reflect on things - by doing this you can pivot or place yourself in a position that lends itself to better opportunities
* Compounding effects - following your curiosity so that the person going to bed tonight knows more than the person that woke up this morning

I’ve split the list of resources into 2 parts. Part one focuses on internal factors, while part two focuses on external factors.
## INTERNAL aka Who are you?

1. (⏱️~3 hours) __Know your priorities__: what is important to you? Why are you currently not fulfilled?
To work this out I recommend reading Tim Urban’s post on the Wait But Why blog about [picking a career that suits you](https://waitbutwhy.com/2018/04/picking-career.html).

TL;DR: Make a list of all the things that you need and want (Tim refers to these as yearnings) such as, passion, money, freedom, respect, meaning, impact etc. Including ones that you may not feel particularly proud of such as status for instance, then rank them in order of importance. The one highest on the list is your “priority”. This is the minimum you need in order to feel fulfilled.

2. (⏱️~30mins) __Know where you belong__: [Peter Drucker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker), father of management thinking and the author of the short book ['Managing Oneself'](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Managing-Oneself-Harvard-Business-Classics/dp/142212312X) argues that by __knowing where you belong__ you can be highly effective.

TL;DR:  By knowing where you belong, you will know which type of work to say yes to and which type to say no to, which team sizes you thrive in most, which type of environments positively stimulate you etc. "Successfull careers are not planned, they develop when people are prepared for opportunities because they know their strengths, their method of work and their values. Knowing where one belongs can transform an ordinary person, hard working and competent but otherwise mediocre into an outstanding performer."
If you know the following three things about your self, then you will know where you belong:
- Your strengths
- How you perform
- Your values

Ways to figure out the above:
* Your strengths: keep a track of any big decisions you make by making a note of the result you expect, then 9-12 months later, compare your notes with the actual results. With time, you will learn where your strengths lay, where you are or are not making a use of those strengths, where you are competent and where you don’t have a strength.
* How you perform: determine how you learn, wether you work well with people or prefer to work alone, whether you are an adviser or a decision maker etc
* You values: this one’s self explanatory


3. (⏱️~10mins) __Accountability and your response to expectations__: The 'Four Tendencies Framework' splits people into four categories based on how they respond to expectations. You can read about it [here](https://gretchenrubin.com/2013/10/what-kind-of-person-are-you-the-four-rubin-tendencies/) and take a quiz [here](https://quiz.gretchenrubin.com/). This won’t take long but knowing which category you fit into best will help you determine how to best keep yourself accountable. We will use this knowledge in part 2 of this series.

4. (⏱️varied) __Principles__:
