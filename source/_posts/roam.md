<!-- I'm a big fan of online courses. But I'm also quite picky with which ones I get, since they require a time and financial commitment. In my experience, a good course should fulfil 3 general roles:

- create one or more mindset shifts (think differently)
- alter behaviour (behave differently)
- be enjoyable! -->

I love taking online courses. But I also have limited time and resources, so I'd like to get the most out of them. Since I started using Roam, I've taken around 5 online courses and I've come up with a simple system to make the most out of them. The system fulfils 3 important goals:

- Better understanding and recall
- Easy to summarise and create content out of. Eg: blog posts or twitter threads
- Low friction - it shouldn't take the joy out of taking the course

The notes are generally made up of 3 parts:
- **Metadata (Tags, Price, Link)**
- **Takeaways**
- **Modules**


<h1 style="font-size: 1.6em;">The Takeaways Section</h1>

This is the most important section of the whole page. The idea is to write the parts that stand out into your own words. This is key. The only thing more important is to apply the lessons as you go. What I also do is to grab block references to copy the parts that standout. For these, I might also use [progressive summarisation](https://fortelabs.co/blog/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes/) as I reflect on them. Here's an example of a course I started recently.

    style="width: 100%;
    display: block;
    margin: auto;"

Then, I use an attribute called **mine** (for lack of a better word) which is how I respond to a "prompt". These allow me to reflect on the material right away and apply the lessons to my life.

I've started creating content from the courses I take. For example [this post](https://infodistillery.com/twitter-course/) on Daniel Vassallo's Twitter course probably took about 2 hours to write. All I had to do was take my takeaways section and expand around it. A few months after publishing this post, Daniel started offering an affiliate link. That affiliate link helped me make my first $ online which was pretty cool. If it weren't for writing the material in my own words as I went through it, I wouldn't have been able to summarise the course so easily.

Lastly, I want to talk about courses that are ongoing. Recently I took a course called The Art of Accomplishment (blog post coming soon) which was a live cohort that spanned across 8 weeks. There were numerous group exercises as well as solo exercises to complete per week. In this case each section became a page in itself.

And as you can see making the Takeaways section a page made it easier to add to it on my daily note as I went through the course.

However, for small self-paced courses like those mentioned earlier, having Takeaways as an attribute works well. Of course, attributes (created by entering `::` after the word), become pages in Roam. Which is pretty cool, because at a quick glance I can see the takeaways from the short self-paced courses I've taken.


<h1 style="font-size: 1.6em;">A Note on Recall</h1>

Personally, I don't use any memorisation techniques for remembering the contents of online courses. In my opinion, the best way to "remember" the lessons is to apply them, in other words, create experiences out of them. The other method is to create content off the back of it. My goal is to have the simplest system (rather than an elaborate one) that allows me to internalise the material, create something out of the material and have fun doing it.
