Podcasts are like having a thousand different mentors available to you at your convenience. It is one of the things that makes me incredibly excited to be alive right now. I‚Äôve made a list of some of the best episodes of my favourite podcasts.

## The Tim Ferriss Show

This is a life changing podcast, as bold of a statement as that may sound. Tim finds the most inspiring individuals to explore all things life related, by asking them them well thought out questions. I can‚Äôt begin to describe how much impact it has had on my thinking.

Sam Harris is one of the most eloquent speakers out there, he has an ability to lay out his points like no other. He invites guests from various domains, some of whom he agrees with, and some he disagrees with. If you like his podcasts you may also like his books.
