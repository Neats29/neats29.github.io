Podcasts are like having a thousand different mentors available to you at your convenience. It is one of the things that makes me incredibly excited to be alive right now. I’ve made a list of some of the best episodes of my favourite podcasts.

## The Tim Ferriss Show

This is a life changing podcast, as bold of a statement as that may sound. Tim finds the most inspiring individuals to explore all things life related, by asking them them well thought out questions. I can’t begin to describe how much impact it has had on my thinking.

Sam Harris is one of the most eloquent speakers out there, he has an ability to lay out his points like no other. He invites guests from various domains, some of whom he agrees with, and some he disagrees with. If you like his podcasts you may also like his books.

This is a very fun and insightful podcast, especially when you consider how young the host is compared to the rest on this list. It covers marketing, technology, cities, communities and a lot more.

All things health-related. Be prepared to hear some biochemistry jargon, but the episodes are videoed and Rhonda helpfully provides definitions on the screen as they are being mentioned.

Jeff Meyerson is a machine. He publishes an episode everyday 😱. These are very insightful, mostly programming episodes that delve deep into a given topic. The episodes range from machine learning to dev-ops, blockchain and more.

👩‍💻 [Reality with Donald Hoffman](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/02/02/reality-with-donald-hoffman/)
(_Not a programming episode per se but a mindbending one nevertheless, Donald Hoffman also appears on [After On](https://after-on.com/episodes/026)_)

Technical episodes:
👩‍💻 [Blockchain Building with Daniel van Flymen](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2017/10/12/blockchain-building-with-daniel-van-flymen/)
👩‍💻 [ShapeShift with Erik Voorhees](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/2018/03/30/shapeshift-with-erik-voorhees/)

P.S. I'm going to add to this list as I find more gems.
