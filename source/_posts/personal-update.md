*I learn so I can live a better life; I distill the information to save you time.*

I‚Äôm starting a newsletter called ‚ÄúDistilled‚Äù where I write about cool stuff I‚Äôm learning about, as well as new posts on the blog. I hope you enjoy it.

# Personal Update
I changed jobs recently and started working at [Echo Health](https://www.echo.co.uk/) last week. Echo is a UK-based online pharmacy startup that delivers your prescriptions free of charge. It makes receiving ongoing medications particularly easy. At Echo, almost every process from ordering medications from the supplier to dispensing and delivery uses tech in one way or another. It‚Äôs a well orchestrated system and I am excited to start contributing to it. I‚Äôll be using The [Go language](https://golang.org/) and [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) to do this.

Before that I had a glorious time off, camping in [Wales, UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales), reading, writing and accidentally attending a brilliant magic act by [Magical Bones](https://www.instagram.com/magicalbones/). I was reading and writing at the [Wellcome Collection](https://wellcomecollection.org/) in London and as I was leaving I learned that there was a special event themed around magic, so I decided to stay.

Magical Bones gave the most entertaining magic show of the night, doing a [backflip while catching the correct card mid-air](https://www.instagram.com/p/BrVhTS4FrTb/), for instance. But the most memorable was the story of [Henry Box Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Box_Brown). A 19th-century slave who had the ingenious idea of mailing himself in a wooden box to abolitionists in Philadelphia, rendering him free.

# Reading

Currently, I‚Äôm reading [Barking Up the Wrong Tree by Eric Barker](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Barking-Wrong-Tree-Surprising-Everything/dp/0062416049/?tag=baupthwrtr-21) which is brilliant. I plan to write a summary of it in the coming weeks.

Keith Rabois's career advice: 
*Select your boss, somebody you can learn from, who's excellent, if that goes well, you'd be preparing yourself for over a longer time horizon to be in the right place at the right time, but you shouldn't try to choose the right place and right time specially early in your career.*
