Intro

<h1 style="font-size: 1.6em;">We are Vessels for the Genes</h1>

Genes are a force of nature, their sole goal is to be passed on. They use animals as vessels to achieve this goal.

However they can't communicate with the animal, "so instead they control them by having them run on specialized survival software."

The animal software uses a series of **behaviour-manipulation tools** to control the behaviour of the animal

"By sliding the animal’s feelings up and down, an animal’s software uses the feelings like reins to keep the animal’s goals and the genes’ goals perfectly aligned."
A few million years ago, the great apes decided to give super-high intelligence a go. It consumed way too much energy but they did it anyways. with that came reason. with reason came the power to imagine. And with reason and imagination combined, came empathy.

They ended up with two minds. **The Primitive Mind** (animal software) and **The Higher Mind** (independent new consciousness).

The never-ending struggle between these two minds is the human condition. It’s the backdrop of everything that has ever happened in the human world, and everything that happens today. It’s the story of our times because it’s the story of all human times.

<h1 style="font-size: 1.6em;">The Human Giant</h1>

Billions of years ago single cells came together to form organisms.

It resulted in a loss of individuality but there were many advantages, so it stuck.

"A single cell is itself a giant—a living giant made up of trillions of non-living atoms. an animal is a higher-level giant made up of trillions of cell. This concept—a bunch of smaller things joining together to form a giant that can function as more than the sum of its parts—is called __emergence.__ We can visualize it as a tower."

Animals form an even higher level giant by joining together, such as a school of fish, colonies of ants or a packs of wolves.
The giant that humans form is known as the **tribe**.

“When most of us consider what constitutes a **complete life form** and what doesn’t, it usually comes down to **independence**”
“We think of the sponge as a life form, but we think of each of its cells as mere __parts__ of a life form”
But remove an ant from its colony and it won’t survive
“Because each of us is an animal...**we’re biased to think of the animal as the key level along Emergence Tower**—the point where the primary **life form** always exists”
<img> x2
In the world that we were designed for, it was the human tribe that was the independent life form **not** the human individual
So…
To understand human nature, **we need to understand the tribe**.
That’s how we can learn why we are the way we are.
"For the human genetic line, sustenance was a survival requirement, so we evolved to be hungry. Reproduction was a survival requirement, so we evolved to be horny. Not falling off a cliff was a survival requirement, so we evolved to be scared of heights. **Tribe well-being was a survival requirement, so we evolved to be tribal.**"

<h1 style="font-size: 1.3em;">Conflict</h1>

When humans are scared, they form **giants**

**The bigger the threat, the bigger the giant they form**
