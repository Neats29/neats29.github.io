<h1 style="font-size: 1.6em;">Why you should invest</h1>
<h1 style="font-size: 1.6em;">An important note</h1>

You should only start investing if you don't have any consumer debt (credit card, personal loans etc). The interest on these loans is usually higher than the gains you'll get by investing, so it's best to pay them off first. This does not apply to student and/or mortgage loans because the current interest rates are low. More on student loans later.

<h1 style="font-size: 1.6em;">The LISA</h1>

The first step is to work out if you'd like to buy a house if you don't already own one. If you do and are under 40, then you can put away up to £4K a year into a LISA account and the government will give you a 25% bonus on top! That is £1000 every year, and any gains on the stock market will be tax-free. If you choose not to buy a house, you can use the funds at 50.

<h1 style="font-size: 1.6em;">The stocks & shares ISA</h1>

Next, we have the stocks and shares ISA account (similar to the Roth IRA in the US), this is the main tax-free investing account in the UK. Set one up and you can invest up to £20K a year (or £16K if you have maxed out your LISA). While you can take your money out at any time, you should think of any money you put in as a 5-10 year or more investment. This will ensure that you don’t make any losses. The important thing is to have enough of a buffer in cash so that you don’t have to panic-sell your ISA stocks in an emergency or when the stock market goes down. You only lose money if you sell at a loss, so be patient.

Conventional investing advice suggests that you pick index funds instead of individual stocks. Index funds such as the S&P500 track the market by grouping hundreds of top companies (in this case 500). By selecting an index fund, you are diversifying your risk, if one company or one sector goes down, you still have exposure to many more.

<h1 style="font-size: 1.6em;">Pensions</h1>

If you are an employee, it’s important to stay opted into your workplace pension. If your employer does a contribution match then make use of it. If you’re a basic tax payer (less than £50,271 a year as of 2021/2022) then you should put in as much as your employer matches and put the rest into an ISA or LISA. So let's say your employer matches up to 5%, you should also put 5%, then you can put the rest of your savings into an ISA account which you have access to any time (rather than waiting for retirement).

If you’re a higher taxpayer (40%) however, you can contribute more to your pension to reduce the taxes you pay. You can effectively pay enough into your pension to make yourself a basic taxpayer. Here's a [calculator](https://www.thesalarycalculator.co.uk/salary.php) to see how much pension you have to pay to avoid paying less or no 40% tax.

It's important to note that you will have to pay taxes once you withdraw from your pension at retirement, however, it’s possible to pay less than 40% by giving yourself a lower retirement income. So you do save in the long run. But remember you cannot withdraw those funds until your late 60s.

It's important to note that most pension providers set you up with a pension fund that has an "average" risk profile, meaning the fund is made up of a combination of stocks (riskier) and bonds (safer). If you're young and have a number of years to go before retirement, you can log into your pension account and increase the risk level. Given that your pension pot is your longest investment, you have time to ride out the market downturns.

<h1 style="font-size: 1.6em;">How to get started right now</h1>
<h1 style="font-size: 1.6em;">Ethical investing</h1>

The downside of investing, and investing in index funds in particular, is that you will inadvertently invest in companies whose products may not be in line with your ethics. Ethical investing is similar to veganism or going plastic-free, it, unfortunately, requires more deliberate effort, reduces your options and may cost more.

To find ethical funds, you need to look for the "ESG" label, which stands for **Environmental, Social, and Governance**. This is a scoring system that excludes or includes companies based on the ESG criteria. While this system is useful, it is far from perfect and can be gamed. So the best way to decide for yourself whether a particular ESG fund is in line with your values or not is to look up the "fact sheet" of the fund and research the companies listed in that fund.

<h1 style="font-size: 1.6em;">Student loans</h1>

In general, there are two student loan plans in the UK. Plan 1 and Plan 2. For Plan 1 (pre-2012 in England and Wales, and 2012 onwards in Scotland and N. Ireland), the interest rate is always lower or up to inflation meaning that you're effectively not really paying any interest so it doesn't really make sense to overpay. [Here's a great video](https://youtu.be/IJKFu1yEKBc) on this.

For Plan 2 students, while the interest rate is higher, the majority of people (unless you're a high earner) will not end up paying back the loan in full before the loan is cleared after 30 years. For this reason, it also doesn't make sense to overpay. [Here's a detailed post](https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/students/repay-post-2012-student-loan/) on this.
