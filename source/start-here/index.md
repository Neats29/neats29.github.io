My name is Anita Amini and I’m a Software Engineer in London. I love learning, climbing and deep conversations.

__My favourite thing is to learn, in order to live life intentionally. My second favourite thing is to distill that information and share my experience with others; hence this blog 😀.__

I work at a UK-based online pharmacy startup called [Echo](https://echo.co.uk/), which delivers prescriptions free of charge. I write in the programming languages [Go](https://golang.org/) and [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/). Prior to that, I was working in the blockchain space, building applications on [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/).
