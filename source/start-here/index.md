My name is Anita Amini and Iâ€™m a Software Developer in London. I love learning, climbing and deep conversations.

I was born in Iran, but my family and I moved to London when I was 10. I ended up studying Pharmaceutical Science at University, because as any Asian kid knows, there is an expectation to study medicine or a branch of it. When I graduated, I started working in clinical trials but I didn't see a future in it. I finally started learning to code in my free time, which led to attending the [Founders & Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) bootcamp, radically changing my life. Now my dad wants to know how to learn to code! 

Learning to code has shown me how life-changing access to the right information can be. Above all, the thing that brings me the most joy, is the __experience of learning__. What I love doing, is to take what I learn and distill it down to the fundamentals so that others can gain an understanding in a fraction of the time. This is why Information Distillery was born.
