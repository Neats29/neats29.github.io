My name is Anita and I‚Äôm currently a [feral free agent](https://www.visakanv.com/blog/feral-free-agents/). 

At the end of 2021 I left my software engineering role after getting burnt out. Although I have done many years of inner work, the burnout was a huge catalyst to help me heal. I had the freedom to really dive deep into some of the work I had started in previous years. It was a year of profound self-discovery and breakthrough.

<h1 style="font-size: 1.4em;">Somatic sessions</h1>

During this time I started to hold 1:1 space by facilitating IFS and breathwork sessions. It was also the year that I finally learned to love myself fully after 3 years of exploration. I now hold 1:1 self-love sessions under a modality I'm calling "Somatic well-being practice". You can find out more about [these sessions here](/coaching).


<!-- This year, I also co-created [Somalist](https://somal.ist/) a directory of somatic practitioners such as therapists, bodyworkers and breathwork practitioners.  -->

<!-- I use writing as a way to make sense of this world. I love distilling what I learn and sharing it with others. The coolest side-effect is making friends online, so  -->

If anything you read on this blog resonates, please reach out to me on twitter [@neats29](https://twitter.com/neats29), I'd love to hear from you.

About three years ago, I had a wake up call when I realised that I was working hard to get far in my career mostly to impress my colleagues. Realising this thrust me into a journey to figure out what really mattered to me and what I wanted. I figured out __what influenced me and where those influences came from__, I figured out what kind of a life I wanted, and more importantly __I figured out how to design my life accordingly.__

I've distilled everything I've learned on this journey into a __short set of introspective exercises__ and a set of __frameworks to work towards the life you want.__ Find out more [here](../course).
